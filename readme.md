Demo of Spring Petclinic compiled Ahead of Time via GraalVM Native Image. It uses MySQL database. This for Oracle Opensource Virtual Connect Series on November 2020. 

This repo has been tested with GraalVM Enterprise v20.2.0 for JDK 8.

To build just execute shell script
```
./build.sh
```

It also provide multi-stage docker builds. However the compile time is longer
```
./build-on-docker.sh
```

Enjoy the lightning speed start up time :-)


Thanks,
